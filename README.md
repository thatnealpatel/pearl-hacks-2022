A demonstration project part of my tech talk at Pearl Hacks 2022 entitled "How To Think About Problems."

### Getting Started

1. Clone the project from GitHub, and change into the project directory `$ cd pearl-hacks-2022`
2. Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` (e.g. `$ mv .env.example .env`)
3. Follow the instructions on https://core.telegram.org/bots to create your bot secrets (step 6).
4. Edit the `.env` file and update it with your secrets.
5. Install Python3.10 or higher (see if you have it installed `$ python3 -V`)
6. Create a virtual environment with `$ python3 -m venv venv`
7. Activate your virtual environment `$ source venv/bin/activate`
8. Install the project dependencies `(venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt`
9. Run the application `(venv) $ python main.py`
